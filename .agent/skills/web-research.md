# Web Research Skill

When the user asks you to research a topic:

1. **Clarify scope** — Ask what depth they need (quick overview vs. deep dive)
2. **Search broadly** — Use web search to find multiple sources
3. **Synthesize** — Combine findings into a clear summary with key takeaways
4. **Cite sources** — Always include links to sources
5. **Save to memory** — Store the research summary for future reference

## Triggers

- "Research...", "Look up...", "Find out about...", "What's the latest on..."
- Any question about current events, recent developments, or factual queries
