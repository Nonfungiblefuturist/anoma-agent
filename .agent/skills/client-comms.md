# Client Communications Skill
When drafting client-facing messages:
1. Match the tone to the client relationship (formal for new clients, warm-professional for established)
2. Always include specific deliverables or next steps
3. Reference project details from memory
4. Keep emails concise — no more than 3 short paragraphs
5. Offer multiple versions if the situation is sensitive (scope changes, pricing, delays)
Triggers: "draft email", "write to client", "follow up with", "client message"
