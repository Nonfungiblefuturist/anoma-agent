# Slack Triage Skill
When processing Slack messages or notifications:
1. Categorize by urgency: 🔴 needs response now, 🟡 respond today, 🟢 FYI only
2. Summarize each thread in one line
3. Draft quick responses for urgent items
4. Save important decisions or action items to memory
Triggers: "slack messages", "triage", "notifications", "what did I miss"
