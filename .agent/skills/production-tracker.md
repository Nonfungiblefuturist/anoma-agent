# Production Tracker Skill
When the user discusses production tasks, shots, deliverables, or timelines:
1. Track shot status (concept, in-progress, review, approved, delivered)
2. Note deadlines and flag upcoming ones
3. Save project updates to memory with tags like "jaipur-living", "production", "deadline"
4. Offer to summarize current production status when asked
Triggers: "shot list", "deliverables", "timeline", "production status", "what's due"
