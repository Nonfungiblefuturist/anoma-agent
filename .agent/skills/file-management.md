# File Management Skill

When the user asks you to work with files:

1. **Understand the goal** — What does the user want to create, edit, or organize?
2. **Plan first** — For multi-file operations, outline the plan before executing
3. **Execute carefully** — Make changes one at a time, verify each step
4. **Summarize** — Report what was done and any issues encountered

## Triggers

- "Create a file...", "Edit...", "Organize...", "Rename...", "Move..."
- Any request involving file system operations

## Guidelines

- Always confirm before deleting files
- Create backups when editing important files
- Use clear, descriptive file names
